- 👀 I’m interested in ...

-   I make video games. You guys can't see my private repos
-   you'll just have to live with that. I don't want to manage
-   pull requests or whatever. And my games are not really
-   open source despite being a FOSS gamer. I think anything
-   I make or made would be pretty average or noobish so
-   don't fret about it, you're not missing out on some
-   galaxy brained code.
   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
